Asynchronous programming with fast actors (replies without future) and keyed sequences has been developed as part of the AgileWiki project, which is included in its entirity in this repository. 

While the overall effort is to convert this code base entirely to this new style of asynchronous programming, complete with a versioning graphical database and a template-driven front end written in Groovy, the code for fast actors can be found in the Scala package org.agilewiki.util.lite.
